## 👋 About Me

I’m **Kushagra Thakur**, a Product Manager and former research scientist with **14+ years in industrial AI, Asset Performance Management (APM), and vibration-based condition monitoring**.

I work at the intersection of:

- **Industrial AI & Machine Learning**
- **Vibration analytics & reliability engineering**
- **Cloud-native APM platforms & edge intelligence**

Over the years I’ve:

- Led APM and Industrial AI offerings at **Honeywell**, working with customers across oil & gas, mining, chemicals, and logistics.
- Built and productized solutions for **vibration monitoring, anomaly detection, failure prediction, and Remaining Useful Life (RUL)**.
- Filed multiple **US patents** in AI, knowledge graphs, and security analytics (one of them has **190+ citations**).
- Worked hands-on with customers like **Aker BP, Shell, Reliance, Freeport-McMoRan, Cardinal Health, Adidas, and Gordon Food Services** to turn algorithms into real operational value.

My long-term mission:  
> **Use industrial AI to extend asset life, reduce waste, and “fix this planet” one machine at a time.**

## 🔭 Current Focus Areas

- **Industrial Vibration & Condition Monitoring**
  - FFT, envelope demodulation, spectral features
  - Wireless sensors (LoRaWAN, BLE) and edge devices
  - Thresholding, diagnostics, and RUL estimation

- **Asset Performance Management (APM)**
  - Unifying process data, mechanical health, work orders, and energy KPIs
  - Cloud-native APM (SaaS) + on-prem deployments for critical facilities

- **Applied AI / ML**
  - Time-series modeling and anomaly detection
  - Causal reasoning and copilot-style assistants for reliability engineers
  - Knowledge graphs for industrial systems

- **Developer & Research Tools**
  - Python-based vibration toolkits
  - Small testbeds at home (pumps, motors, gearboxes) for experimentation
  - Agents / LLM tools for research workflows
